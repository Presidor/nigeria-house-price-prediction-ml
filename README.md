# Nigeria House Price Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project develops a machine learning model that predicts house prices in Nigeria based on property features such as location, size, and housing attributes. The project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment through an interactive prediction app.

The goal is to provide data-driven insights for real estate pricing and support property valuation decisions.
